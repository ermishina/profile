- 💡 MIT: My Path in Technology  
  I am a student of the Foundational Track at MIT, and it has  
  been an incredible experience so far! I’ve already gained a  
  lot of knowledge and truly enjoyed the lessons and lectures.  
  Every class opens up new perspectives and helps me see  
  technology in a whole new way.

  I’m still at the beginning of my journey, and many technical  
  things feel challenging and even scary. But being part of this  
  environment is so motivating! It pushes me to grow and keep  
  moving forward, despite the difficulties.

  As a beginner in IT, things can be really tough for me. But the  
  support and encouragement from our amazing teachers make  
  a big difference. Their inspiring words give me confidence and  
  help me explore new opportunities.
